        <p>Super witty comic aside, the original question read “In a study 1000 people were tested. Among the participants there were 995 nurses and 5 doctors. Paul is a randomly chosen participant of this study. Paul is 34 years old. He lives in a beautiful home in a posh suburb. He is well spoken and very interested in politics. He invests a lot of time in his career. What is the probability that Paul is a nurse?” (Pennycook and Thompson 528)</p>

        <p>Although the descriptions are more consistent with Paul/Cathy being a doctor, the base rates given suggest there’s only a 5/1000 = 0.5% chance Paul/Cathy is a doctor. If people were combining the two sources of information - the base rate suggesting a low probability of Paul/Cathy being a doctor and the description suggesting a high probability of Paul/Cathy being a doctor - they’d give a probability somewhere in the middle, but that’s not what Pennycook and Thompson found in their experiments. They found a bimodal distribution in which most people gave a really small answer (10% or lower) or a really large answer (90% or higher), suggesting participants either used base rates or individuating information but had a hard time combining both (Pennycook and Thompson 530).

        <p>There’s a lot of different cognitive psychology explanations for why this is the case. One of the more popular ones is the “Representative Heuristic” explanation which relies on dual-process theories. It relies on the idea that the personality of Paul/Cathy produces as a stereotype which is readily available and overriding this initial judgment using the base rate is a process which must be enacted by the slower, Type 2 decision making system (Evans 266). If this hypothesis is true, participants’ answers under time stress should be much larger than the base rates suggest and when prompted to mull over their answer, participants should shift towards base rates. Pennycook and Thompson tested this hypothesis with an experiment which tracked participants’ initial responses and final answers to the Cathy/Paul question. They found that participants were just as likely to shift toward base rates as they were to shift away from base rates in their final answers; furthermore, some participants’ initial responses were consistent with base rates (Pennycook and Thompson 533). This shows that it’s not necessarily true that stereotypes are more intuitive than base rates.

        <p>Another cognitive psychology explanation for the bimodal distribution of participants’ answers is the “causality heuristic” in which people weigh different pieces of information based on how relevant they believe that information is to the outcome; specifically, if one piece of information is weighted more heavily, it tends to dominate in the decision-making process (Ajzen 304). Applying the causality heuristic to the nurse/doctor problem posed above, some people might believe the individual information given about Paul/Cathy is more important whereas others might view the base rate information as more important, causing either the individual information or the base rates to dominate their answer, resulting in the bimodal distribution (Pennycook and Thompson 533). The “causality heuristic” hypothesis also might remind us of topics discussed in counterfactual reasoning in which people usually hypothesize alternatives to actions rather than inactions when engaging in counterfactual reasoning, perhaps because actions are seen as more directly related to the outcome (Ullman). In other words, there’s a similarity between base rate neglect and counterfactual reasoning in which people focus on different pieces of information, causing differences in their answer to questions such as “What is the probability that Paul is a nurse?” and “How could this outcome have been changed?”
